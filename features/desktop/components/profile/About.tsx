      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Ronis, a self-taught web developer with a background in mechanical
        engineering. My engineering experience has honed my problem-solving and
        analytical skills, which I've successfully applied to web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past few years, I've been building projects and gaining
        expertise in technologies like React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. While
        I don't have professional web development experience, my portfolio
        showcases real-world projects that highlight my skills and commitment to
        learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always eager to take on new challenges and continue growing as a
        developer.
