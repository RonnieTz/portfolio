      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Ronis, a self-taught web developer with a background in mechanical
        engineering. My engineering experience has honed my problem-solving and
        analytical skills, which I've successfully applied to web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past few years, I've been building projects and gaining
        expertise in technologies like React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. While
        I don't have professional web development experience, my portfolio
        showcases projects that highlight my skills and commitment to learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m always eager to take on new challenges, refine my skills, and
        collaborate on exciting projects. Whether it’s building responsive web
        applications or solving complex coding problems, I’m ready to bring
        fresh ideas and technical know-how to every project.
