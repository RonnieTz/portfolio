      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I&apos;m Ronis, a self-taught web developer with a background in
        mechanical engineering. My engineering experience has honed my
        problem-solving and analytical skills, which I&apos;ve successfully
        applied to web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past few years, I&apos;ve been building projects and gaining
        expertise in technologies like React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. While
        I don&apos;t have professional web development experience, my portfolio
        showcases projects that highlight my skills and commitment to learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&apos;m always eager to take on new challenges, refine my skills, and
        collaborate on exciting projects. Whether it&apos;s building responsive
        web applications or solving complex coding problems, I&apos;m ready to
        bring fresh ideas and technical know-how to every project.
